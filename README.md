# OSSF Security Tooling

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions related to the group's mission and charter.

## Objective

Our mission is to provide the best security tools for open source developers
and make them universally accessible. We want to create a space where members
can collaborate together to improve upon existing security tooling and develop
new ones to suit the needs of the broader open source community.

## Vision

Our vision is to improve the perception of security in open source software.
